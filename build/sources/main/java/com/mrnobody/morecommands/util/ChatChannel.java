/**
 * A ChatChannel is a channel to broadcast chat messages.

 * Therefore a ChatChannel has a parent channel (except for the master channel)
 * and optionally child channels. Unless otherwise specified by a child
 * channel, a parent channel sends all chat messages to its child channels.
 * Every ChatChannel has a ChannelPolicy which defines who is allowed to
 * join this channel. A ChannelPolicy is inherited by a channels parent
 * which means that child channels check all the ChannelPolicies of its 
 * parents to determine whether a player can join.
