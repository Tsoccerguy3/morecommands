/**
 * Every kind of setting which is managed by a {@link SettingsManager}
 * is wrapped into this class. Every settings can depend on different 
 * {@link SettingsProperty}s.
 * <p>
 * Dependent means that this setting is only intended to be available in
 * an environment where the properties of the environment match the
 * properties of this setting.
 * </p><p>
 * For each {@link SettingsProperty} there can be multiple allowed
 * values. These values are stored in a set. If there is no mapping
 * from a property to such a set or the set is empty, this means that
 * every value is allowed.
 * </p><p>
 * Since all the settings objects returned by a settings manager are
 * stored in that manager, all changes made to a settings object are
 * reflected in the settings manager. This way you can avoid calls
 * to store()-Methods. It is recommended to use the {@link Setting}
 * objects directly instead of extracting the value.
 * </p><p>
 * <b>IMPORTANT:</b><br>
 * Generally it's recommended to use this class only as a wrapper or 
 * as an accessor for settings. This means that this class works as a "gate"
 * that forwards any change to the settings manager so that changes are
 * reflected in the settings manager. This class is not meant to be compared, 
 * so don't use any collections or other methods which rely on equality
 * especially in terms of the equality of the value. See the {@link #equals(Object)}
 * Method to get more details.
